# degamte
**DE**utsch **GAM**e **TE**st

game-test for deutsch learners


This repository holds Tkinter version of degamte. For now it's just small python script (funny_test.py) that starts the game. It contains only one question. In the future I will do web-version of this game.

To be continued...
